Installation
To run the chatbot locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-chatbot.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd student-chatbot
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the chatbot:

python chatbot.py
Alternatively, if deploying via Flask:

python app.py
Usage
Once the chatbot is running, you can start interacting with it through the console (or a web interface if using Flask).
Ask questions like:
"Can you suggest a project topic for computer science?"
"What are the submission deadlines?"
"How should I format my final report?"
The chatbot will respond with relevant information or guide you through the available project details.
Customization
To modify the chatbot for your specific needs:

Update the chatbot's knowledge base by adding more FAQs to the database or training the chatbot with new data.
Customize the conversation flow by editing the chatbot's logic and natural language processing settings.
If you're using Flask for web deployment, you can customize the front-end interface to improve user experience.
